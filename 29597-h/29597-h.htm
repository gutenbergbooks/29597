<h2>NEIGHBOR NELLY.</h2>

<h3>IN THREE STORIES.</h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE OLD BACHELOR'S STORY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the city block where I live,
there are just twenty-four houses on
the other side of the street, and twenty-four
on this side, six lamp posts, and
eight ailanthus trees in green boxes.
Oh, dear me, what a tiresome row!
That's what I thought when I first
came to lodge here; for, as I am an
old bachelor, I don't want a whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
house to myself; but now, when I sit
at my window and look out at the
street, I find no end of things to amuse
and interest me; particularly when
the gas is lighted of an evening, and I
can see a little way into the parlors
of the opposite neighbors. I suppose
they know that an old bachelor like
Josiah Oldbird can do no harm by
looking on at their evening amusements;
so they do not pull the blinds
down if they chance to see me, sitting
lonely at my window, and willing to
accept such crumbs of their society
and happiness as I can glean over the
way.</p>

<p>First, then, is the family at No. 7,
three maiden sisters and a bachelor
brother. As I don't in the least know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
their names, I have dubbed them the
Bluejays, because the three maiden
sisters always wear blue merino gowns
in winter, and blue muslin ones in
summer; and because they are all so
fond of singing that no family of birds
could be more musical. They have a
pet poodle and a pet squirrel, too.
The poodle is very fat, and his hair
sticks out so much all over him, that
he looks perpetually astonished, as if
he had just seen a spook. He always
stands on the window sill, when the
sash is raised of an afternoon, and
glares into the street until he sees the
bachelor brother coming. Then he
achieves a series of frantic yells and
bounces, until somebody comes to
open the door and lets him out, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
he waddles to the front steps to meet
his master, wagging his tail to that
tremendous extent, that it looks like
the shuttle of a steam power loom.</p>

<p>The squirrel is slim and sleek, and
seems to enjoy life amazingly, he hops
about so. When one of the Miss Bluejays
takes him in her arms, he won't
stay there, but gets away, and walks
all over her head and shoulders; and
at last runs down her back and disappears.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 202px;">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="202" height="200" alt="Sit down on a chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>Then, at No. 11, a very fat gentleman
lives with his fat and pretty wife,
and round dumpling of a baby. As I
don't know him either, I call him Mr.
Fatty, and he seems to be a "good-natured
giant." I saw a little boy actually
stop short to stare at him the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
other day, when he was sitting out at
his front door&mdash;he is such a regular
roly-poly of a gentleman&mdash;but he only
laughed good-temperedly, and never
got vexed in the least. I don't advise
you to try this with all fat gentlemen
though; they might accidentally sit
down on a chair&mdash;where you were&mdash;afterward,
and that would be the last
of you. This piece of advice, however,
is a great secret between you and me!</p>


<p>He is so glad to meet the fat baby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
when he comes home at night, that I
can see him in the parlor first kissing
it almost black and blue, and then tossing
it up in the air until I feel as though
its head must come bump against the
ceiling, but it doesn't&mdash;and at last,
carrying it off perched on his shoulder,
and looking very much perturbed
in its spirits.</p>

<p>But the pleasantest neighbors of
all live exactly opposite, at No. 9.
They take tea every evening in the
back parlor; and as the front window
shades are up, and only the back
room lighted, I can always see them
at their cheerful meal. The rooms are
furnished in winter with dark red velvet
carpets and furniture; with red
damask curtains and red velvet paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
hangings. In summer they put up
white curtains, and carpets and furniture
have cool, cream-colored linen
coverings, so that the parlors look
cozy and charming at all seasons.</p>

<p>As for the family there is a papa
and mamma, of course, and a dear little
girl and boy. The little girl is about
ten years old, I should think, with
great, dark-blue eyes, and curling auburn
hair. Her cheeks are as rosy as
ripe peaches, and her teeth as white
as so many pearls. Her nose does
turn up at the end a little, to be sure;
but that is rather saucy and becoming
than otherwise; and she always looks
so sweet tempered, and full of fun, too,
when I see her of an evening, that I
am sure she is as good as pie, and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
merry as a cricket! Her little brother,
who is a year or two younger,
looks very much like her, and their
obedient and pretty behavior at table
is something really beautiful to observe.</p>

<p>It is nearly a year now, since I
moved into my lodging at "No. 10,"
and began to wonder what No. 9's
name was; and now I must make
haste and tell you how, only last June,
I became acquainted with these dear
little neighbors of mine.</p>

<p>One pleasant Friday morning, after
breakfast, I put on my old-fashioned
beaver hat, and taking my gold-headed
cane in one hand and my market
basket in the other, I trotted out to
buy something nice for dinner; for,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
you see, I am a particular old bachelor,
and like to market for myself.</p>

<p>Just as I was coming down the
steps, the door of No. 9 opened, and
the little girl ran down <i>her</i> steps. She
looked so bright and pretty in her
cunning round straw hat with the blue
ribbons, and white Marseilles cloak,
carrying her satchel of books and
lunch basket in her hand, that I could
not help nodding to her. So she nodded
to me, and then <i>I</i> nodded again
and smiled, and we each walked along
on our own side of the way. When
we came to the corner I thought I
would cross over and scrape some
more acquaintance with my little
neighbor. Now on the side of her
satchel, I saw, when I came near her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was printed in gold letters, "Nelly
Lawson;" so I said, as cheerily as I
could, in my old, quavering voice:</p>

<p>"Good morning, Neighbor Nelly!"</p>

<p>The little maiden looked up in my
face in a shy fashion at first; but when
she saw what a mild, gray-headed old
bachelor had bade her good morning,
she took courage, and answered,
"Good morning, sir."</p>

<p>"So you are going to school this
fine day?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I go to school, but brother
Jimmy doesn't; he learns at home. I
think he is going next year. Have you
got a baby at your house? We have."</p>

<p>"No," said I, sighing; "I haven't
got any baby; I am an old bachelor.
Will you marry me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I am too little," she replied
quite seriously. "You will have to wait
until I grow up to you."</p>

<p>I laughed, and asked her, "Don't
you want to go to market with me
before you go to school? There is
plenty of time."</p>

<p>"No," replied my little neighbor,
firmly; "I can't go anywheres that
mamma does not know of."</p>

<p>"That's right!" I said. "Don't do
anything your mother would disapprove.
Well, Neighbor Nelly, since
you won't go to market with me, I
must go to school with you; and tell
your mother that Neighbor Josiah
Oldbird would like you to take a walk
with him to-morrow; will you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! that would be real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
nice!" said my little neighbor with
a joyous skip.</p>

<p>By this time we were walking
along hand in hand; and soon, seeing
my little neighbor look in at the window
of the candy shop round the corner
from our street, I thought I would
take her in and buy her some candy.
So in we marched, Nelly's great blue
eyes dancing with pleased expectation,
and stood close by the counter, waiting
for our turn to come. There were
a good many people in the candy
shop, and we had to wait some time;
so, to amuse ourselves, Neighbor Nelly
and I turned round, and began
looking at the funny folks near us.</p>

<p>There was one very fat old country
woman, who seemed to be buying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
"quarter or pound," as she said, of
every kind of candy in the shop. As
soon as the papers were handed to
her she began eating out of them, and
before she left, I should think, she had
eaten about two pounds of candy.
Besides the old woman, there were a
great many little children, who only
wanted a penny's worth each; but
they hesitated so long whether to
have "taffie" or "molasses," a lemon-candy
horse, or a cinnamon-candy
trumpet, that they were the most
troublesome customers of anybody.
Then there were several older boys
and girls; some, I am sorry to say,
picking up a loose bit of candy every
time the shopman turned away&mdash;as if
that were not stealing; and finally,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
there was Neighbor Nelly and I, who
did none of these things, but just
looked on, and waited until the shopman
came to serve us.</p>

<p>I bought some lemon candy, as
clear as a bit of yellow glass, and
some pungent cinnamon, and delectable
chocolate; and then I popped the
papers into Neighbor Nelly's satchel,
and we hurried on to school. We had
not far to go now, and when we came
to the house, my little new friend bid
me good-by, and thanked me so
sweetly, that I went away quite a
happy old bachelor.</p>

<p>In the evening I was looking out
of my window as usual, when I saw
the servant girl come in to light the
gas in the back parlor at No. 9, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Neighbor Nelly and the little brother
Jimmy behind her. While she was
setting the tea table, the children
came running to the window, and
both nodded and smiled at me. Presently
the little boy thrust both hands
in his pockets, and held them up
crammed full of candy. "Thank you,
Mr. Old Bachelor!" he shouted; "we
like you real well!"</p>

<p>That made me real happy; for I
am not a crabbed old bachelor by any
means. In a minute more their father
came home; and as they all sat around
the pleasant tea table, I hope they
talked of their lonely old neighbor,
who watched them from his window.</p>

<p>The next morning, as I was reading
the paper, in came the servant and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
gave me the funniest little note! It
was addressed on the outside, "To my
neighbor Oldbird," and ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">My dear Neighbor</span>:

<p>"Mamma says I may take a walk
with you this morning, because you
are a good old bachelor. Jimmy wants
to go, and Gipsey. Gipsey is my dog.
He is black and tan, and his tail curls
round so, that papa says you might
use it for a cork-screw. Jimmy and I
mean to try some time. Gipsey likes
to be on the seashore, and so does
baby. We are going there next week&mdash;to
Long Branch. I hope you will
write me a letter when I am gone, and
I am&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your affectionate</p>

<div class='sig'>"<span class="smcap">Neighbor Nelly</span>.<br />
</div>

<p>"<small>Saturday Morning.</small>"</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>You may believe how pleased I
was with this dear little note, and I
thought I would answer it. So I sat
down at my writing desk, found a
cunning little sheet of paper, with a
flag on it, and commenced.</p>

<p>Now I happened to think, at that
moment, of some very comical letters
written by the great poet, Tom Hood,
to his little friends on the seashore;
and as they were ever so much funnier
than anything I could have written,
I copied one of them out, and sent it
to my little new friend.</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">My dear Neighbor Nelly</span>:

<p>"I am very glad you are to walk
with me, and very sorry you are going
away so soon. Do you like to be on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the seashore? I did, when I was a
boy. I and my brother chucked hundreds
of stones into the sea, when we
were there, but we came away before
we could fill it up. Then there is the
fun of finding shiny pebbles and jelly
fish on the beach. I used to think
jelly fish were made of sea-calves' feet,
and no flavoring. I suppose the mermaids
eat them at their parties.</p>

<p>"Then there's fishing on the seaside.
I used to catch flat fish sometimes,
with a long string line, it was
like swimming a kite. If you go out
in a surf boat, take care it does not
"flounder" and get "squamped," as
some people say, instead of founder
and swamped.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been bathed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the sea? I was, and, dear me! how
I kicked and screamed; or, at least,
tried to scream, but the sea, ships and
all, began to run into my mouth, and
so I shut it up. Remember, when you
are bathing, if you meet with a shark,
the best way is to bite off his legs, if
you can, before he walks away with
yours; and pray, pray, pray take care
of yourself in the sea, for in some
places, they say, it has not even a
bottom to go to.</p>

<p>"Could you bring me a little crab
off the beach? If you would catch
one for me, and teach it to shake
hands without nipping and biting, it
would make me quite happy, for I
have not had any toys or playthings
in a long time. It would be a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
plan to hire a little crab to teach the
baby to crawl, if he can't walk yet.
Bless him! But I must not write on
him <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'anx'">any</ins> more; he is so soft, and I
have nothing but steel pens.</p>

<p>"Now good-by; give my love to
everybody, and my compliments to all
the rest, and believe me, up hill and
down dale,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Your affectionate neighbor,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Josiah Oldbird.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>Then I put my letter in a flag envelope,
sealed it up tight, and wrote
on it, "To my dear Neighbor Nelly,"
and had the maid take it to her.</p>

<p>Presently I could see two little
figures flitting about in one of the upper
chambers, and soon after all four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of us, Nelly, Jimmy, I, and Gipsey,
were in the street. Gipsey was a "toy
terrier" that ought to have belonged
to "Commodore Nutt," the dwarf at
"Barnum's," and ran along on three
legs most of the time, with the fourth,
and his cork-screw tail elevated in
the air for joy at being allowed to join
the party; while the children were all
hop, skip, and jump, and kept tight
hold of a hand of mine apiece, as
though they were afraid of flying
away if they let go. Meanwhile, I
walked quietly along, with my market
basket on my arm, a sober old bachelor.
I expect the people who passed
us in the street thought me a rather
incongruous addition to such a frisky
party; but then, you know, children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<i>must</i> caper about. Bless your heart!
it would never do in the world to see
children mincing solemnly along, like
little old men and women; it would
be as absurd as to have my Neighbor
Nelly wearing her great-grandmother's
coal-scuttle bonnet! The last idea
struck me as so odd, that I drew a
little picture of Neighbor Nelly in this
guise when I got home, and here it is.
How do you like it?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="294" height="300" alt="In the bonnet" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>We thought we would go to market
first. So we walked slowly down
Fourth Avenue, and crossed over to
the market where the Seventh Regiment
armory is, opposite the Cooper
Institute.</p>

<p>"My cousin is a Seventh Regimenter!"
said Jimmy as we climbed
up the iron steps; "he often let us
look on at his company drills last winter,
and afterward Nelly and I drilled
in our yard. The big boy who comes
to see the old ladies next door, looked
over the fence and laughed at us, but
we didn't care; and we mean to fight
for our country like everything when
we are bigger; that is, I mean to, and
Nelly would like to, but she's only a
girl, you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only a girl!" repeated Nelly,
tossing her long curls; "girls are a
great deal of use, too; I mended all
his stockings and all papa's this week&mdash;think
of that, neighbor Oldbird!"</p>

<p>"That was really splendid!" said
I; and just then we entered the market.</p>

<p>The very first thing we met was a
horrid big dog, that belonged to some
butcher; and, bless me! how he began
to show his great rows of teeth,
and growl at Gipsey! Nelly gave a
little scream, and tried to hide behind
me; Jimmy valiantly flew at the big
dog with my walking stick; and poor
little Gipsey nearly stood on the end
of his tail with fright, and squealed
dismally. What a fuss we were all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in, to be sure! So at last, to quiet the
disputants, I caught Gipsey up, and
put him in my coat pocket, where he
sat, looking out at the top, very much
comforted.</p>

<p>Then we turned to the right, and
went by the brightest and prettiest
stall in the whole market. It was
kept by a Frenchman, who, in his
own language, would be called a
"<i>charcutier;</i>" but Jimmy and Nell
shouted out together "Oh, there's the
<i>pig man!</i>" as loud as ever they could,
and then stopped, blushing very much,
because they were afraid the pork
merchant heard them. I expect he
did; for he looked very funny when
we came close, and smoothing down
his snowy apron with his fat hands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
said "Bonjour, mademoiselle!" and
laughed good humoredly. There was
a great "head cheese" on the pig
man's marble counter, moulded in the
shape of a boar's head. The tusks
were made of white carrots, the eyes
of red jelly, and the sides of the dish
it was on were beautifully ornamented
with white roses, cut out of turnips,
and parsley foliage. Then there were
ever so many pork pies, with the most
elegant wreaths of flowers on the top
crust, comical little hams already
cooked, and fat dumplings of sucking
pigs, as pink as baby himself!</p>

<p>When we had looked about us a little,
we concluded to buy a pork pie of
the pig man; and while that was being
nicely packed up in paper, out popped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Gipsey from my pocket, and stood
triumphant on the counter, in the
midst of the little pigs and savory pastries.
I don't know what forays he
would not have made upon them, if
he had not been captured by the pig
man, Jimmy, and me; but he did contrive
to jump right into the very middle
of another pork-pie! and then we
had to pay for that, too; and wipe
the gravy off Gipsey's feet and the
ends of his tail and nose, and button
him up tight in the market basket for
half an hour, as a punishment for his
naughtiness. As to the pie we had
bought, Jimmy carried that, and Gipsey
cut up so many antics inside the
basket, that he nearly wriggled it out
of my hand altogether.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>After that we went on, and found,
dear me! such a comfortable old market
woman, who sold us a nice little
chicken, and some fresh vegetables,
and gave the children each a great
handful of cherries; but we had to
tell her to send them home, with our
pie, because Gipsey had the basket in
possession.</p>

<p>Then we walked into the street
again, and when we had let Gipsey
out of prison, concluded to leave the
basket at my baker's, and take a walk
in Broadway. Dear, dear me! what
quantities of shop windows there were
to stare into, and how we flattened
our three noses, and spread our six
hands all over every one of them,
while we admired the splendid picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
books, the stores of sugar plums,
or the wonders of toys they contained!
While we were occupied in this way, a
little girl, poorly dressed, and lugging
a large bundle of work in both arms,
came along, and stopping beside us at
the window of the most splendid toy
shop, stood looking wistfully in.</p>

<p>Neighbor Nelly straightway twitched
my hand, and whispered, "Oh look,
Neighbor Oldbird! what a poor little
girl! I don't suppose she ever saw a
doll before in her life. How she must
wish she had one!"</p>

<p>"Suppose we ask her?" I said.</p>

<p>"Will you ask?" she answered;
"I don't like to."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! ask her yourself; she
won't eat you, or Gipsey either;" for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Gipsey was sidling away between my
feet, as if he were alarmed too; the
saucy scamp!</p>

<p>Thereupon Nelly moved closer to
the poor girl, and said, in a kind, little,
timid voice, "Do you like dolls?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very much!" said the child,
with a surprised look.</p>

<p>"Oh, so do I!" cried Nelly, rapturously.
"I have lots of them at
home; let me see, there's Jenny, and
Willie, and old black Nanny, and&mdash;"
she stopped short, seeing the other
look wistfully at her, and then said,
"Oh, I forgot! you have none, perhaps;
would you like to have one?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, miss!" said the child;
"not so much for myself, though, as
my little sister; she is sick, and can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
do anything, poor Clara! but I work,
and help my mother!" she added,
proudly.</p>

<p>"What does your mother do?"
asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"She makes shirts for the army;
and I do all the button holes."</p>

<p>"I can't make a button hole," said
Nelly, regretfully.</p>

<p>Here I proposed we should walk
into the shop, and after we had looked
all we wanted to at the pretty things,
and the children, with screams of delight,
had ridden in turn on a "spring
rocking horse," that sent them flying
half way to the top of the glass cases
behind the counter, I gave Jimmy and
Nelly each two shillings, and told them
to buy whatever the little girl would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
like best. The poor little thing's eyes
sparkled with happiness when Nelly
bought her the composition doll she
chose out of a heap that were piled in
a great basket, gorgeously dressed in
pink mosquito netting, as I thought, but
which Nelly informed me was a "tarletane;"
and Jimmy laid out his money
on a tiny bowl and pitcher of sprigged
china ware, and an astonished china
baby sitting in a bath, and looking as
if it had turned on the hot water, and
couldn't turn it off again.</p>

<p>Then we trundled Gipsey about a
little in a wicker wagon we found, and
put him in the patent baby-jumper to
take an airing; and at last, when we
had teased him till he barked like one
of the toy poodles on the shelves, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
took ourselves off, and sent the poor
child on her way rejoicing.</p>

<p>But it was getting late, and time
to trot home, before His Majesty the
Sun roasted us all like so many eggs.
Our street is always shady and cool, it
seems to me, and we were glad enough
to find ourselves once more on its
pavement. I invited Nelly and Jimmy
and Gipsey all to take lunch with
me, and didn't we have fun! We <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'eat'">ate</ins>
the pork pie, and stuffed Gipsey with
lumps of sugar, and discovered a pot
of raspberry jam in the closet, and ornamented
ourselves with red rims
round our mouths, digging it out; and
sliced, and buttered, and disposed of
almost half a loaf of French bread,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and hardly stopped laughing, chattering,
and barking a single minute.</p>

<p>And then, after all this was over,
my little neighbors bid me good-by,
and Gipsey barked at me and poked
his cold nose into my hand, which
meant "Good-by and thank you," all
the same, and the three went home as
merry as crickets.</p>

<p>I could not see much of my little
neighbors before they went away the
next Tuesday, but I was invited to
take tea at No. 9 the very last evening;
and then, what should I find out
but that Nelly's mamma was the
daughter of an old friend of mine
whom I had not seen for years! So
we felt quite like relations right away.
Just as tea was over, lo and behold!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
there was a tremendous hullaballoo
on the back piazza, and when we
poked our heads out of the window to
see what the matter was, there was
Gipsey high and dry on the back of
Miss Bluejay's fat poodle&mdash;having
squeezed through the railing which
separated the two piazzas&mdash;with the
squirrel, which had come to the rescue
of his friend, hanging on to his tail!
and all three setting up a squeal of remonstrance.
Gipsey's plight was so
extremely well deserved, that we
wouldn't go to his rescue; but at last,
with a tremendous twist, he snatched
away his cork-screw tail, and ran to
hide himself and his injured feelings
under the sofa in the front room.
How we laughed at him! and how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Nelly tried to make him come out
and be lump-sugared into good humor,
but he wouldn't; so, to make up,
we coaxed the fat poodle, which had
been staring in at the performance and
sniffing satisfaction, to sit up and beg
for us until we gave him the lump of
sugar. Then Mrs. Lawson sat down
to the piano, and began playing a
funny little hornpipe tune that sounded
just like a banjo; and, to our astonishment,
the fat poodle developed
another accomplishment; for, getting
on his hind legs, he gravely hopped
up and down on the piazza, keeping
time to the music, until we nearly
died of laughter.</p>

<p>You may fancy, after all these
comical doings, that we managed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
spend a merry evening, and when I at
last bid my neighbors good night, it
was no longer with the feeling that I
was a lonely old bachelor.</p>

<p>I did find the street pretty lonely
though, after they had gone, next
day, with two great big trunks
strapped on behind the carriage, a
middling sized trunk hoisted up in
front, and several small carpet bags,
and tiny tawny bundles and baskets
in every place where room could be
found. I fancy Gipsey was in one of
the baskets, by the way it bounced
and wriggled about in Neighbor Nelly's
lap; but I don't know; I only
saw it from my window, whence I
waved an adieu to them as they rolled
away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after they had gone,
I thought I would amuse myself, in
their absence, by trying to find out if
any of the other neighbors knew anything
about my neighbor, Nelly. I
succeeded in learning what two of
them knew, and they shall tell it for
themselves in the stories that follow,
and which I have written out. And
now, if any other dear little children
have been pleased with me, in what I
have told of my walks and talks with
Neighbor Nelly, just let them come to
No. 10, and meet the hearty greeting
and loving welcome of the</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE BIG BOY'S STORY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">You</span> want me to tell you what I
know about the pretty little girl next
door? Well, I'm ready to begin, if
you won't mind my talk; I'm only a
boy, you know, and can't use fine
words&mdash;that's all humbug.</p>

<p>My name is Tom Halstead. I am
nephew to the Miss Brandlaws, who
live at No. 7. The idea of calling my
darling old friskies "The Bluejays!"
(If you don't give me that Australian
post stamp I saw in your desk, I'll tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
'em, too!) However, to go on with
my story.</p>

<p>One morning last winter, just at
the end of the Christmas holidays,
while I was on a visit there, I didn't
know what on earth to do with myself.
So I caught Poddles (that's the
poodle), dressed him up in Aunt Elsie's
nightcap, tied a life preserver round
him, and put him in the portable
shower-bath, just for fun; it didn't
hurt him a bit, and&mdash;would you believe
it? the hateful thing hopped
out, squealing murder, shook himself
all over the carpet, scratched off the
nightcap, and danced round the room
with it in a fury, till it was in perfect
rags.</p>

<p>Up rushed Aunt Elsie, and was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
horrified when she saw the carpet and
her cap in such a mess, and "darling
doggie" all "wetsey-petsey," that she
locked me up in my room for the rest
of the day on bread and water! and
there was gingerbread, with raisins
in it, baking down stairs!! Horrid!!!</p>

<p>Of course I couldn't spend my time
sucking my thumbs; so, like a sensible
fellow, I set myself to find some better
employment, and soon a grand idea
came into my head. I had just finished
reading a jolly old-fashioned
novel I found in Uncle Herbert's
room, called "The Castle Spectre: a
Tale of Spain;" where a goose of a
lover, such a spooney! had scrambled
down from the top of a castle, hanging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
on to his bedclothes. <i>Now</i>, don't
you see it? Perhaps not, so I'll explain.</p>

<p>My bedroom is the third floor, back
room, always; and you know that piazza
at the back of the house? Well,
what did I do, but twitch off <i>my</i> bedcover&mdash;nice
white one it was, too&mdash;tie
it to the bedpost, and let the end
hang out of the window. Then I
scrambled out, and slid down the wall
like a streak of lightning! You can't
think what jolly fun it was!</p>

<p>There was lots of amusement in
the yard; twelve cats on the fence to
plague, and no end of snow to make
balls and pelt the cook with; beside,
the gingerbread was just baked, and
I got a <i>brown corner!</i> So! there!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
while I was eating it, and it was so
hot that it almost sizzled, all at once
I heard a lot of noise in the next
yard. Some boys seemed to be having
a drill there; so I ran up the steps
leading from the piazza to the ground,
and looked over the fence. But lor
now! what do you think? one of the
boys was a girl! She had on long
india-rubber boots, and I called out,
"Go it, Boots!"</p>

<p>Then the little boy that was with
her, who seemed to be her brother,
looked so mad at me! and, really and
truly, I couldn't help plaguing them a
little. I know you think I was real
mean; but if you had seen how funny
they looked, in paper cocked hats,
with turkey tails for feathers, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
little boy thumping a big tin saucepan
for a drum, you would have laughed,
too; so you needn't look so provoked,
Neighbor Oldbird!</p>

<p>"Gee up, awkward squad!" I
said; "double quick halt on the
right flank! Ha-ahup!"</p>

<p>But the little girl only laughed
good humoredly, and said: "Jimmy
and I belong to the Seventh Regiment,
and drill in the last fashion.
Don't you want to come and learn the
Lefferts Tactics?"</p>

<p>Wasn't she a nice little thing!
Never got mad or anything, but just
gave me back as good as I sent. I
declare, I fell right smack in love with
her that minute, and I don't care a fig
now for the girl I met in dancing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
school, upon my word I don't; so I
rushed back into the kitchen, coaxed
the cook to give me two more hunks
of gingerbread, and called out, "Won't
you have some cake?"</p>

<p>They came running up on the piazza
like lamplighters; and while they
were eating the gingerbread, <i>I</i> was
eating something I got especially for
myself at the same time. Did you ever
try it? You have a great big sour
apple, as cold as it can be, and a tremendous
pickled pepper, as hot as it
can be; then you take first a bite of
the pepper, and nearly burn all the
skin off your throat, and then a bite
of the apple to cool it again; and so
on. It's gorgeous, I tell you!</p>

<p>Presently the little boy (whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
name, as I said, was Jimmy), stopped
his eating to ask me, "Do you live in
New York?"</p>

<p>"No, I live at White Plains. I go
to the Military Academy there; don't
you want me to show you some
drill?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cousin Charley is going to
teach us some time. He belongs to
the Seventh Regiment. We love to be
soldiers, though, and we know a boy,
Freddy Jourdain his name is, who got
up a whole regiment, and has parades,
and went into camp, and everything."</p>

<p>"We have a camp at White Plains,"
I told them. "Do you ever go there
in summer, Miss&mdash;&mdash;" here I stopped,
rather awkwardly, not knowing what
her name was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not 'Miss' anybody;"
she said; "I'm Nelly; but we go to
the seashore in summer 'most always."</p>

<p>"Can't you dress up in your uniform,
and show us how you look at
school?" said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like;" here I remembered
that the key of my room was in
Aunt Elsie's pocket, and had to say,
"but I can't get into my room now; I
was locked in, and Aunt Elsie has the
key."</p>

<p>"How do you come to be here,
then?" said Nelly; "why, dear me,
just look at the counterpane hanging
out of the window; how funny!"</p>

<p>"Why, that's the way I got out!"
I said; and so I told them all about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"The Castle Spectre," and "Lord
Alonzo Algernon" Spooneyman, and
we got into such a perfect <i>gig</i> of
laughter, that we nearly rode off in it!
(Now, don't say that's not a good joke,
or I'll not tell another word of my
story.)</p>

<p>Just then out came Poddles, looking
as surprised as ever; and Nelly
exclaimed, "Oh, there's that funny old
dog! what do you call him?"</p>

<p>"His name is Poddles!" said I;
"<i>I</i> christened him."</p>

<p>"What a queer name!" said Jimmy;
"let's take him into our house
and see what Gipsey and he will do!"</p>

<p>"Good!" said I. So, without remembering
that plaguey white spread,
I cut over the piazza railings with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Poddles under one arm, and we all
three rushed up stairs together.</p>

<p>They had such a famous play room,
with a splendid swing, and a teetertorter,
and ten-pins, and I don't know
what beside; and there was the nattiest
little dog! but you know him,
that "toy-terrier" of theirs. Poddles
looked a greater fright than ever
beside him; so, to pay him off, we put
that wretched Pod into a basket, tied
it fast to the swing, and swung him
up to the ceiling. It frightened him
half to death, and serve him right, for
being so ugly! after which he and
Gipsey went to sleep in a big rocking
chair, as friendly as possible. Then I
gave Nelly a splendid swing, "ran under,"
and cracked my cocoanut three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
times, beside making my arms ache
like everything; but I didn't care, she
was such a dear little thing.</p>

<p>Afterward Jimmy went and got a
great plateful of rosy apples; and just
as we were eating them, and having
such fun, up came one of our girls,
and said that "Miss Brandlaw wanted
Master Tom right home!" Wasn't it
hateful? But, of course, I had to go;
so I bundled Poddles under my arm
again, bid them good-by, and walked
off with Mary; but I poked her ribs
and set Poddles at her all the way,
which was some comfort.</p>

<p>I expected a scolding when I came
home, and I didn't have one&mdash;oh no!
Aunt Elsie wanted to know where I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>thought I should die when I went to&mdash;(no,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I believe it was the other way,</span><br />
but never mind)&mdash;if I hung best bed
spreads out of the window, and left
my room without permission? besides
informing me that she should write to
ma', and have me sent for. Finally,
she marched me up stairs again; and
when I said I <i>must</i> have something to
do to keep me out of mischief, she
gave me a Sunday school book to
read, and took herself off.</p>

<p>Of course you will say I was dreadfully
wicked not to like the Sunday
school book, but I couldn't. It was
so full of hard names and long words,
and was all about sanctification and
justification and regeneration, and
how was I to understand a word of
it? I love Bible stories, but I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
think there is a boy or girl who <i>understands
hard doctrines</i>. Do you,
Neighbor Oldbird?</p>

<p>I pretty soon gave up that employment,
and amused myself instead with
pelting the cats on the fence with a
few marbles, and trying on my uniform,
to see how I looked in it; until
Aunt Elsie relented, I suppose, for she
came up and asked me through the
keyhole if I was sorry, and wouldn't
do any more. You can fancy what
my answer was, and after dinner I got
permission to go out and play on the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>Neighbor Nelly and Jimmy joined
me there pretty soon, and we had
such fun playing "tag" and driving
hoop. It wasn't hoop <i>time</i>, to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sure, but that was no matter. Then,
when we were tired of that, we all sat
down together on the upper step of
No. 9, and began talking about their
school and mine, and what we learned.</p>

<p>"Do you ever learn pieces of poetry?"
asked Nelly. "My teacher,
Miss Backboard, always gives the girls
each a piece of poetry every Friday;
so we call that poetry day."</p>

<p>"I used to learn pieces too," I
said; "but I don't care much for poetry
unless it's funny."</p>

<p>"Tell us a funny piece," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Ah yes, do!" added Nelly; and,
of course, when a <i>lady</i> asked me I
had to, though I felt pretty bashful;
so I began.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<div class='hang1'>
Oh dear! was there ever anybody so unlucky as I am,</div>
<div class='hang1'>From General &mdash;&mdash;, who lost that battle t'other day, all the way back to Priam!</div>
<div class='hang1'>Come, sit down&mdash;do, and let me tell you all about it, and what's the matter;</div>
<div class='hang1'>Perhaps it will do me good to have a nice, comfortable, miserable chatter.</div>
<div class='hang1'>To begin, then. This morning I woke, and thought I was up with the sun.</div>
<div class='hang1'><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>So never hurried myself; but dressed slow, and came down, to find breakfast all done,</div>
<div class='hang1'>And nothing left for me but one cold slapjack, and all the chicken gone,</div>
<div class='hang1'>Unless, to be sure, I could have eaten the drumsticks, and one perfectly clean breast bone!</div>
<div class='hang1'>And, of course, I had to make haste, for it was nine o'clock and after,</div>
<div class='hang1'>And the master had offered a prize to the earliest boy&mdash;and here was I beaten by even lazy Tommy Shafter!</div>
<div class='hang1'>But it was no use to fret, so I snatched up my satchel, and would have been off in a minute,</div>
<div class='hang1'><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>When lo and behold! my geography was gone; and though we hunted the house, it was plain it wasn't in it,</div>
<div class='hang1'>Till at last I remembered that yesterday I had gone after school to the dog pound,</div>
<div class='hang1'>And then been fishing with Fred Lee; so, probably, it was at the bottom of the frog pond!</div>
<div class='hang1'>Well, off to school I went, and came in after every schoolmate;</div>
<div class='hang1'>So, to pay me off, the schoolmaster and all the boys called me Bobby Toolate!</div>
<div class='hang1'>But that wasn't all; for the class was just up for spelling,</div>
<div class='hang1'>And I didn't know the lesson, and Tommy Shafter prompted me to spell boots <i>butes;</i> and that's all I got for telling,</div>
<div class='hang1'><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>Besides going to the foot of the class, and having to get the lesson over;</div>
<div class='hang1'>I tell you what! a hand-organ monkey's life, compared to a schoolboy's, is perfect rolling in clover!</div>
<div class='hang1'>And I wish I was a monkey, if I did get beaten&mdash;yes, that I do&mdash;</div>
<div class='hang1'>In a red coat all over spangles, and blue trowsers, and a long tail behind to come through!</div>
<div class='hang1'>Well, thank goodness, it's over; but that's not the half of my pother;</div>
<div class='hang1'>For the very minute I got out of school, Tommy Shafter began to plague and bother,</div>

<div class='hang1'><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>So I did; but there's spikes on the top of that gate; and, confound it, I went to work and tore my trowsers!</div>
<div class='hang1'>Just then along came Miss Kitty Snow, and didn't I look dashing,</div>
<div class='hang1'>And that hateful Tommy Shafter bawled out "How are you, trowsers?" and jumped down and walked off with her; but just see if I don't give him a thrashing!</div>
<div class='hang1'>To pay him off for what he did and more too; for, when I came home weeping and wailing,</div>

<div class='hang1'>So I had the pleasure of seeing the rockaway drive up to the door,</div>
<div class='hang1'>And pa and ma getting in, and sister Tilly, and brother Sam, and ever so many more,</div>
<div class='hang1'>All looking so happy and gay, and not caring a bit for poor Bobby,</div>
<div class='hang1'>Just as if I <i>wanted</i> to get into scrapes, and mischief and bad conduct were quite my hobby!</div>
<div class='hang1'>Then off they whirled; and as I was left alone, I thought I might as well be up and doing.</div>
<div class='hang1'>Oh, good gracious, why didn't I sit still? but how could I tell what was brewing?</div>

<span class="caption">BOBBY AND ROVER.</span>
</div>
<div class='hang1'><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>So I went to the stable to see our big dog Rover, and thought I would take him out with me;</div>
<div class='hang1'>When, just as I had slipped his chain, he broke loose, and ran, I don't know where! and, I'm sure, pa will never forgive me!</div>
<div class='hang1'>For he thought so much of Rover. Oh, dear me, what shall I do?</div>
<div class='hang1'>If it would be any use in the world, I really think I should begin to boohoo!</div>
<div class='hang1'>The stable boy told me not to take him; but I should like to see myself minding him <i>rather;</i></div>
<div class='hang1'>And of course, out of revenge, he'll just go and make the worst of it to father.</div>
<div class='hang1'>Well, one would think that was enough; but when I came back to the house, oh jolly!</div>
<div class='hang1'><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>There was our big cat just making a spring at sister Tilda's pretty polly!</div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="400" height="292" alt="The cat making a spring" title="" />
</div>
<div class='hang1'>And in my haste to save the bird I threw the poker at the cat and killed her!</div>
<div class='hang1'>And got myself in for a scolding from ma, and no great thanks from Tilda.</div>
<div class='hang1'>It's six o'clock now; so, I suppose, they'll soon be home as cross as any Tartar,</div>
<div class='hang1'><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>To give it to me for being such a bad boy, though I'm sure I'm a regular martyr;</div>
<div class='hang1'>Don't you think so now, after all that I've just been telling?</div>
<div class='hang1'>No breakfast, no geography, late at school, tore my trowsers, kept at home, lost the dog, killed the cat, and didn't know my spelling!</div>
<div class='hang1'>I think the best thing I can do is to go to bed, put my head under the clothes,</div>
<div class='hang1'>And in a good, comfortable sleep try to forget all my sorrows and my woes;</div>
<div class='hang1'>But you may be sure, after this, I shall not neglect to take warning,</div>
<div class='hang1'>And begin to-morrow all right, without any sort of fail, by getting up early in the morning!</div>


<p>"There!" said I, when I had finished,
and it quite wore my tongue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
thin to repeat such a long piece of
poetry. "What do you think of <i>that</i>
for a story?"</p>

<p>"I think it is real funny," said Nelly,
laughing; "I wish I knew something
to tell."</p>

<p>"I can say a funny piece!" shouted
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Well, say it, then," we two&mdash;Nelly
and I&mdash;put in.</p>

<p>Up he jumped right off, struck a
funny attitude, and began:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The boy stood on the burning deck,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Peeling potatoes by the peck!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The flames rolled on and scorched his shins,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As he stood peeling potato skins!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Oh pa'!' he cried, 'the flames is hot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come, put the potatoes in the pot!'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But his father, alas! ne'er came to sup,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So the flames rolled on and frizzled him up!"</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ever hear anything so
ridiculous as that?" cried Nelly.
"Poor Casabianca! I used to cry
over him dreadfully; but I shall never
think of him now without laughing.
Where did you learn that, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry Agnew told it to me;
he said he repeated it one day in
school, when the master asked him
if he could say a piece of poetry, and
everybody burst out laughing. The
master laughed too; so he couldn't
put anybody down for a bad mark,
though Harry was afraid he would."</p>

<p>"That was almost equal to the
trick we played at school," said I.
"We wanted the doctor to give us a
holiday, but he didn't seem to see it;
so when we were called up for our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
reading after recess, we were told to
read Montgomery's poem called 'Questions
to Birds and their Answers.' One
of the verses is about the swallow, and
reads thus:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Swallow, why homeward turned thy joyful wing?'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'In a far land I heard the voice of spring;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I found myself that moment on the way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My wings, my wings, they had not power to stay.'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>&mdash;but we changed it as though the
doctor was asking us a question and
we were answering&mdash;this way:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"'Boys! why are you forever on the wing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wanting a holiday for everything?'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'From you we are so glad to get away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Our legs, our legs, they will not let us stay.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>How we all laughed over this; it
was real true, too; and pretty soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
after, as it was getting dark, I bid
them good-by and ran home.</p>

<p>Next morning, what should Aunt
Elsie and Aunt Ruth (Aunt Priscilla
was away on a visit) take into their
heads, but that they hadn't had any
fun house-cleaning&mdash;(I suppose they
must think it's fun, or they wouldn't
do it so often)&mdash;for ever so long; so
nothing would suit them but to set the
whole house in an uproar as quick as
possible. Of course, I was in the way,
whether I stayed in the garret or the
kitchen; knocked down three pails
and a scrubbing brush every time I
went down stairs, nearly drowned
Poddles in hot soapsuds, splashed myself
all over with whitewash trying to
"do" the kitchen ceiling (on my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
account, when nobody was by), until
I looked as if I had been out in a
snowstorm, and watering the windows
outside with the long hosepipe, until
every one of them was dripping <i>inside</i>
like a waterfall.</p>

<p>Now, Neighbor Nelly and Jimmy
had been looking out of their parlor
window, and advising me which were
the best parts of our windows to play
on, when, all of a sudden, Nelly
said:</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, it doesn't half clean
the panes to do them that way; they
ought to be washed with soap and hot
water. Suppose we try it? Only
think!" she went on, "how much
your aunties would be obliged to us
if we were to find out a new way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
make windows clean, ever so much
better than the old one!"</p>

<p>"Splendid!" said I and Jimmy
together. "Come, let's try it right
away!"</p>

<p>With that, Nelly and Jimmy came
into our house, and into the front
basement; Aunt Elsie and Aunt Ruth
were both up stairs; so we had the
two lower stories all to ourselves.</p>

<p>As Nelly was afraid of spoiling her
frock, I dived into the cook's dresser
drawer, where she keeps her own table
covers and clean dish cloths, and
fished out a great big brown roller-towel,
which we pinned round her
neck, making her look in front as if
she was tied up in a potato sack, with
only her head left out. Then Jimmy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and I took off our nice jackets, rolled
up our shirt sleeves, lugged in three
big yellow dishes full of hot water,
spilling plenty on the way, found a
long bar of brown soap, and helped
ourselves to three more of Bridget's
clean towels; and then we all three
began scrubbing away at the windows!</p>

<p>Such fun as we had! We put on
the greatest lot of soap, and paid
away with both hands, so as to make
them good and <i>clean</i>, laughing and
talking all the time; and when we
thought the water had been used
enough, or, rather when it was nearly
all spilt, we took up our yellow bowls
and marched into the kitchen for
more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Our boiler, you must know, is a tin
affair, like a large soup kettle without
the handle, and has a faucet in front
to draw the water off. We put it on
the middle of the range, and keep it
always full and boiling; and now, instead
of filling our dishes right away,
we began playing the kitchen was a
steamboat, and the water heater the
boiler, just ready to burst; so, of
course, it was necessary to let off
steam, which we did by drawing a
little water at a time from the faucet
into one of our yellow dishes, and tilting
it back again as soon as the dish
was full, beside "tooting," as loud as
we could, to represent the commotion
going on to perfection. We were soon
so busy over this, that we forgot all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
about the front basement windows for
ever so long, until we heard Aunt Elsie
calling out, "Tom! Tom! where
are you?"</p>

<p>"Here I am, Aunt Elsie! come
right along! Here we all are, washing
the windows for you as nice as
anything!"</p>

<p>Down marched Aunt Elsie, short
order; and the minute she came into
the basement we heard her give an
"O&mdash;&mdash;h!" about a quarter of a mile
long. We all rushed to ask what was
the matter; and such a pickle as the
windows were in you never did
see. The soap was in streaks, and
smears, and lumps all over the panes,
making them look as if somebody had
spilt a lot of hasty pudding on them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and it had stuck fast. Of course, as
we left them so long, the soap had
hardened on; and poor Nelly, frightened
half out of her wits, began to
cry. That put me up, I can tell you;
I was determined Aunt Elsie shouldn't
scold her; so I begged her not to be
angry with anybody but me, for it
wasn't their fault at all.</p>

<p>"And I must say you are old
enough to know better, Tom," said
my aunt, looking at me reproachfully
over the tops of her spectacles; "and
as a punishment, you must get all the
soap off the window before you have
any dinner. The children had better
go home."</p>

<p>But now, what do you think that
darling of a Nelly, and Jimmy did?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
They declared I shouldn't do it all
alone by myself, but they would stay
and help me; so, after Aunt Elsie had
been coaxed to let us, we filled our
dishes again, and went to work as
busy as bees. It was pretty hard
work getting the soap off, but we made
a joke of it, and by the time the windows
were fairly polished up, as bright
as new pins, we were in a perfect frolic.
I expect Nelly's bright eyes had
something to do with it, for Aunt Elsie,
after we had finished, and come
shouting to her with our faces as red
as fire, and considerable brown soap
on us in spots, said, "we were famous
workpeople," and gave us New Year's
cookies, and almonds, and raisins for
lunch. I had a Philop&oelig;na among my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
nuts, which I ate with Nelly; and
pretty soon after they went home.</p>

<p>I did hope she would catch me on
the Philop&oelig;na, because I had something
that I meant to give her all
along; and this would be a famous
chance. It was a nest of little boxes,
made of plaid papier-mach&eacute;, about a
dozen, one inside the other; and when
you came to the very last, and had
opened that, there was a gold thimble
and scissors, and a little gold bodkin,
a needlecase full of tiny needles, and a
puncher, just big enough for the queen
of the fairies; I won it at a raffle on
Christmas Eve, and kept it to give to
some little girl, for, of course, it wasn't
any use to me; what could I do with
a thimble and needles? Sure enough,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
when I looked out of the back parlor
window next morning, Neighbor Nelly
looked out of <i>her</i> window, said with a
saucy smile, "Good morning, Mr. Tom&mdash;Philop&oelig;na!"
and popped back again.</p>

<p>"Good!" I said. So, after breakfast,
I asked Aunt Elsie for a nice
sheet of paper and a new pen, and
then I ran up to my own room, and
sat down to write a little note to my
neighbor. I'm sure, that showed how
much I liked her, if anything could,
for I'd rather do a sum in compound
fractions, or a French exercise, than
write a note. It quite gives me the
toothache; but at last I wrote something
very pretty, as, I'm sure, you
will say when I repeat it to you. This
is what I said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Nelly</span>:

<p>"I hope you will accept the little
present I send you for a Philop&oelig;na,
because I like you very much. I am
real glad you caught me, for perhaps
this will remind you of me when I go
back to school. I hope the needles will
sew all the holes in your clothes, that
the thimble will keep you from pricking
your pretty little finger, and that</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If you loves I as I loves you,<br />
The scissors won't cut our love in two.<br />
</div>

<p>"Good-by.</p>

<p>"From your affectionate friend</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Tom.</span>"<br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Then I packed up the boxes and
the letter in nice white paper, and
coaxed Mary to take it in right away;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and you can't tell how many pretty,
smiling thanks I had in return.</p>

<p>But you think I am making my
story too long, Neighbor Oldbird?
Well, perhaps I am, but there seems
to be so much to tell about Nelly, and
the nice times we had together, that I
don't know when to stop. I am 'most
through now.</p>

<p>The day I sent her the Philop&oelig;na
present was the last of my stay in
town; and after I had packed up my
clothes ready to start (with a gorgeous
plum cake and two jars of raspberry
jam in a box, which my dear
old Friskies gave me,&mdash;they always do
make everything of me, in spite of
their lectures), I went to Uncle Herbert's
room to bid him good-by, for I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
knew I should not see him again before
I started, and he made me the
best present of all. It was a dear little
watch and chain; for he said, as
I was nearly fifteen, I was quite old
enough to take care of one. Wasn't
that kind of him?</p>

<p>Well, dear me, I don't want to say
good-by a bit, and I did not then;
but, of course, it had to come, and I
shook hands with my dear little
friends, only wishing to goodness that
I lived in New York.</p>

<p>We promised about twenty-five
times apiece always to be friends; and
then I kissed Aunt Elsie and Aunt
Ruth, pulled Poddles' ears for good-by,
and pranced off all alone; of
course, boys that have watches are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
plenty big enough to go from New
York to White Plains by themselves.
I suppose we always shall stay there,
for papa is abominably fond of the
country; but just wait until I am a
man, and see if I don't come to live in
New York, and marry Neighbor Nelly,
if she will have me. Mind you keep
that last remark a secret, now, Neighbor
Oldbird! That's all there is
about it.</p>

<h2>POSTSCRIPT TO THE THREE STORIES.</h2>

<h3>BY THE OLD BACHELOR.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I had finished copying out
the stories of the Big Boy and the Fat
Gentleman last summer, the thought
struck me that, as I had been in town
all the warm bright June weather, it
would do my health a great deal of
good to take a trip to Long Branch.
Of course, it was not to see Neighbor
Nelly&mdash;certainly not.</p>

<p>So, the very next Saturday afternoon
I dusted up my valise, and put
some nice cool summer clothes in it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and a great paper of candy, which I
meant for my little neighbors, in case
I should see them by accident! Somebody
had told me that the Mansion
House was the best hotel to stop at.
Shall I tell you why? Because there
was a party there, of a papa and
mamma, a dear little girl and boy,
and a remarkably nice little toy terrier,
which would put me in mind very
much of some friends of mine called
Lawson. In fact, this family was
called Lawson, too, and the younger
members were christened Nelly and
Jimmy! Comical, wasn't it?</p>

<p>If you have never been to Long
Branch, you can't think what a pleasant
sail it is down the Bay in the
"Thomas Collyer," and how much I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
enjoyed my trip. The pleasant shores
of Long and Staten Islands (<i>I</i> used to
live on Staten Island, and had some
comical times there, which I mean to
write out one of these days) looked
as verdant and beautiful as ever; the
sea was as blue as a bluebottle fly,
and the sun as light as a cork! As I
looked at the great, rolling waves, I
laughed to myself, thinking what nice
times we were going to have in bathing;
ducking under them, when they
came roaring along the shore after us,
as if they meant to gobble us up, and
bouncing out again when they had
passed, all dripping and laughing, and
ready for the next one to play the
same trick on us. Sometimes, to be
sure, the waves play too rough, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
knock you off your feet without "by
your leave;" or a little crab will walk
up and bite your toes, just by way of
welcoming you to Long Branch; but
nobody minds it. Bless you!&mdash;that
only makes it more fun to go in
bathing!</p>

<p>Well, the boat stopped at the pier,
which extends a quarter of a mile from
the shore, putting one in mind of a
long crab's claw stuck out for "shake
hands" by old Neptune; and I jumped
into the cars and was bounced and
rattled along to Long Branch. As it
was Saturday afternoon, a great crowd
of people were going there with me,
and, deary me! when <i>I</i> came to the
Mansion House, there wasn't any room
left for me! Wasn't it too bad? Just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
when I had fixed to have such a nice
time with my dear little friends! It
would never do to go away, however,
so I said: "Well, never mind, Mr.
Mansion House&mdash;that is, Mr. Neighbor
Nelly&mdash;dear me!&mdash;Mr. Laird, I
can do without a room; and at night
you can put me to sleep in the pigeon
house, or the hen coop, or under the
counter of the office, or up the chimney,
I don't care which; but go away
I can't!"</p>

<p>Now, I expect, Mr. Laird must
have known I had come to see Neighbor
Nelly, and what a disappointment
it would be not to get in; for after a
consultation with his bookkeeper, he
told me he could give me a room after
all! and I was so glad, that I offered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
him my snuff box immediately, which
is a favor I only grant to very nice
people!</p>

<p>So up stairs I hurried, to get ready
for tea, in high good humor, and,
would you believe it, when I came
down again, whose table should I be
put to sit at, but Neighbor Nelly's?
Oh, how surprised and pleased she was
to see me! and Jimmy and his father
and mother were just as glad. There
was famous "clam chowder" for tea,
and such great big blackberries, that
we really had to make two bites of
them! not to mention the quantities
of other good things; and after tea
we strolled out on the bluff, which
overlooks the ocean. There are three
pretty little summer houses before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Mansion House, and in one of these
we took our seats. Gipsey had come
scampering up to me in delighted recognition
as we left the dining room,
barking and wagging his tail, until I
should think both his tail and his bark
would have been quite out of joint.</p>

<p>"Oh, Neighbor Oldbird, I'm so glad
you have come," began Nelly, eagerly;
"we have been having such fun,
and, now you are here, it will be nicer
than ever."</p>

<p>"Do you and Jimmy go in bathing?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"I guess we do!" cried Jimmy.
"We rush into the water first of anybody,
and go out real deep, when we
have hold of the ropes. Some great
big boys are as afraid as anything!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
But we like to have the waves go
over our heads."</p>

<p>"Talking about big boys," said I,
looking wonderfully sly, "I made the
acquaintance of a big boy in our
street, not long ago, who knows a
certain little lady very well; and likes
her very well, too!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know!" chimed both the
children; "it's Tom Halstead. Isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he told me something funny
about you, too; I did not know you
could wash windows before, Neighbor
Nelly."</p>

<p>My little neighbor laughed and
blushed comically when I said that,
and then Jimmy said:</p>

<p>"He's a first rate fellow, I tell you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
He sent us a letter the other day, and
what do you think? he's coming
here!"</p>

<p>"Coming here!" I exclaimed;
"my stars! I shall be quite thrown in
the shade when such a nice friend
makes his appearance. I think I shall
have to go home again Monday, and
I did mean to stay till Wednesday,"
and I made up a dismal face, and pretended
to be quite heart-broken.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Neighbor Oldbird!
we shall always like you the best!"
cried Nelly, catching both my hands
in hers. "He is a very nice boy, to be
sure, but we like <i>you</i> just as much as
if you were our bachelor uncle."</p>

<p>"Then I move to be called Uncle
Josiah directly!" I said, laughing;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
"so, my dear niece and nephew, don't
you think it would be a good plan for
us to go down on that nice yellow
sand there, and look at the waves?"</p>

<p>The children were delighted with
this plan, so we all three walked to
the steep wooden steps that lead from
the bluff to the beach below, and were
soon on the sands. Gipsey came racing
after as usual, and in his haste to
join us, ran so fast down the steps,
that he couldn't stop himself, but had
to bring up on the sand past the
water mark, looking comically astonished.
To put a finishing touch to his
misfortunes, a great big wave came
tumbling in just then, and over poor
Gipsey it went! sousing him head and
ears! It frightened him so much that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he rushed dripping wet to Neighbor
Nelly, and jumped into her lap, squealing
dismally. Such a perfect shower-bath
of cold salt water as rained all
over her pretty muslin dress, and trim
little gaiters and stockings! We had
to shake her well, and put Gipsey to
bed on a sandhill near us, where he
went to sleep, and, I hope, forgot his
miseries.</p>

<p>Perhaps you don't know it, but the
sand is a famous place to write your
name. You go as near the retreating
wave as you dare, and then, with a
walking stick or an umbrella, or your
finger, if nothing better is to be had,
write your name, or draw a hideous
spook on the wet sand. You have to
be quick about it, too; for just as you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
are putting the finishing touches to
the work, another great billow is sure
to come tearing at you, with a wide,
deep hollow of emerald green, and
foaming crest, looking like molten silver
in the moonlight. Crash! it falls
on the beach; and a long rush of foam
slides up the sand as you scamper out
of reach, not always without a wet
shoe or two. Now the water has all
run back, but where is the writing?
The sand is smooth once more, and
ready, like a great blackboard, to be
marked on anew. So the sea is always
clearing your writing book for
you, and giving you a chance to begin
again and see how long it will last!</p>

<p>I should think we wrote "Nelly,"
"Jimmy," and "Neighbor Oldbird,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
about fifty times each on the sand,
with my walking stick; and then we
"hung Jeff. Davis on a sour apple
tree," and depicted him with Old
Spookey coming after him, and told
the Atlantic Ocean, "We like blue
fish," and "We're going in bathing
Monday," and never succeeded in
keeping one of our achievements
more than half a minute.</p>

<p>We stayed down on the delightful
beach until nearly half-past nine; and,
dear me, what a heap of sand we got
in our shoes! It was quite wonderful
how it contrived to work its way in;
but there it was, making us lift up
our feet as heavily as though we had
cannon balls tied to our ankles.</p>

<p>But it was getting late, and high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
time for small people to be off to
bed; so, with a shake of the hand
from one of my little neighbors, and a
"good kiss" from the other, I don't
say <i>which</i>, Gipsey was waked up, and
they all trotted off together.</p>

<p>Next morning was Sunday, and a
beautiful sunshiny day. The first
thing I did when I woke up, was to
pop my head out of the window and
take a look at the ocean. There it
was, as beautiful as ever, and now I
found out a funny thing about Long
Branch that I hadn't noticed the
evening before. "Why," said I, "is it
possible I am in the country? Where
are the trees?" They were nowhere
to be seen, not so much as a bush;
while the flowers were represented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
by everybody's bathing dresses hanging
over all the fences, and on ever
so many clothes-lines besides, to dry.
The fact is, that the Atlantic Ocean is
determined to let nothing be admired
but itself; so it will not permit a tree
to grow any nearer its shores than
half a mile. So all the foliage there
consists of the direful old bathing
dresses, flapping in the wind and looking
like so many scarecrows put up
to frighten off the fishhawks.</p>

<p>In the morning we went to the
cunning little Episcopal church, and
listened to the earnest teachings of
the noble young rector, who is working
so bravely in his Master's cause
with such poor earthly reward. That
he is laying up treasure where "neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
moth nor rust doth corrupt," we cannot
but believe. We did not like to
leave the quiet little church for the
great noisy hotels, in one of which, as
we passed it, they were <i>playing billiards</i>.
Oh! what an occupation for
God's holy day! I cannot believe they
were Christians who were playing, but
I know I wanted to go and beg them
to stop.</p>

<p>In the afternoon it clouded up, and
began to rain very hard; so we could
not go to church, and as it was very
little like Sunday in the crowded hall
and parlor, Mrs. Lawson proposed we
should all come and sit in her room,
which opened on one of the upper
piazzas. So we established ourselves
here, where it was quiet and cool,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
very glad to escape from the bustle
down stairs.</p>

<p>"Suppose you were to repeat that
pretty German hymn I gave you the
other day," said her mother to Nelly.
"Perhaps Mr. Oldbird would like to
hear it."</p>

<p>"Yes, that I should," I said; so
Nelly began the beautiful verses
called&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>"ALL THERE."</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Nothing is lost; the treasures which the ocean<br />

<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our hopes shall bloom, unfadingly, in Heaven."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I think that is the best hymn I
know," added Nelly, when she had
finished. "Now, what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Let's play church!" suggested
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Oh yes! that's the very thing!"
said Nelly. "Suppose we ask Kitty
and Robby Morris to come in."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>So Kitty and Robby were found,
and consented to join the play, which
straightway began; mamma and I
looking on, though we made believe
not to be taking notice, for fear of
disturbing the little visitors.</p>

<p>Robby, who was a dear little fellow,
only five years old, with long
golden curls and great blue eyes, was
the minister, at his own special request.
The children dressed him in a
long white sack of Mrs. Lawson's by
way of a gown, and gave him a small
table for a pulpit. The others, with
Gipsey, and a large gray cat, the
property of Robby and Kitty, which
marched in after them, were the congregation,
sitting on the edge of the
bed, to be like the long church pew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
The minister took for his text, "Little
children, love one another," and his sermon
was such a dear, funny little discourse,
that I must write it down for you.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear peoples," he said,
"I hope, whenever you feel like karrelling,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
or being as cross as bears,
you will 'member what the Bible says
'bout loving one another. Gipsey
fighted my tat to-day, and pulled
some of her fur out; but he's only a
dog, and I readed in my Dr. Watts&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Let dogs delight to bark and bite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For God has made 'em so;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let bears and lions growl and fight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For 'tis their nature too.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But, children, <i>you</i> s'ould <i>never</i> let</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Your angry <i>pass'ons</i> rise!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Your little hands were <i>never</i> made</span><br />

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>&mdash;&mdash;so I was not mad at him, 'cause
he didn't <i>know</i> he ought to love
pussy.</div>

<p>"I <i>s'apped</i> nurse the other day,
'cause she made me come out of the
water before I wanted to, and <i>that</i>
was <i>very</i> naughty; I begged her pardon,
though, and gave her a piece of

Now, my dear peoples, I think that is
long enough. S'pose we sing, 'I want

<div class="figleft" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="364" height="600" alt="PLAYING CHURCH." title="" />
<span class="caption">PLAYING CHURCH.</span>
</div>

<p>Wasn't that a cunning little sermon?
It put me in mind of how I
used to play church in my childhood,
long ago; when my young brother,
dear little Davy, would stand on a
chair, while I sat on my stool at his
feet, and preach a sermon something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
like Robby's. Darling Davy! I fancied
I could see his sweet face and
earnest eyes looking down at me,
from his happy home in heaven that
Sunday afternoon; for he closed those
dark eyes on this weary earth many
long years since, and I never think
of him now but as standing on the
chair in our father's study (with, perhaps,
mother looking in, unknown to
him), and preaching from some simple
text that we knew and loved, in
quaint, yet childish words. Ah, well!
perhaps it was better so, than that he
should have lived to be a gray-headed
old bachelor like "brother Jose!"</p>

<p>So the children all sang the hymn,
and that was the end of church. We
passed the rest of the afternoon telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Bible stories, and repeating hymns,
and after tea it was clear once more,
and dry enough to go out on the bluff.</p>

<p>You may be sure, we were all in
famous spirits Monday morning, and
ready for any sort of a frolic. Who
could help being good humored with
such company as my little neighbors?
Mr. Lawson left us in the first train
for the city; but, to make up, who
should have come down in the early
morning boat, but Tom Halstead and
Miss Elsie Bluejay&mdash;or Brandlaw, I
ought to say, since I know her name
now; and they drove straight up to
the Mansion House, of course&mdash;who
wouldn't, when Neighbor Nelly was
there? The children received Tom
with shouts of joy; and he looked so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
handsome and happy, and his great
black eyes sparkled so with good humor
and fun, that I felt quite ready to
admit him into my circle of little people
that I knew and loved. Neighbor
Nelly and he were an admirable contrast
in point of appearance, and I
shouldn't be surprised if the last remark
made to me in strict confidence,
by my friend Tom in his account of
her, should come true some day.</p>

<p>I wish I could sketch a little picture
of our party as we clustered together
on the piazza, to show what
manner of people we were then; and
another, of our appearance in the
water afterward. Ten o'clock was the
hour for bathing that morning; so
we each armed ourselves with our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
bathing clothes and a prodigious
towel, like the main sail of a fishing
smack, and rushed down to the beach;
that is, the younger members; Aunt
Elsie, Mrs. Lawson, and I walked soberly
along. Then we popped into
separate bathing houses, still looking
like respectable and responsible
members of society, and popped out
five minutes afterward&mdash;scarecrows!
spooks! animated rag-bags! with the
last vestige of our gentility and good
looks departed.</p>

<p>Aunt Elsie had taken leave of a
most beautiful brown "front" and
fourteen luxuriant curls, the absence
of which gave her an appearance very
like a staid bald-headed owl; particularly
as she would keep on her very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
round spectacles, and wore a pair of
extremely long-fingered green cotton
gloves. The long ends of the glove
fingers, waving about in the water,
were not unlike the owl's claws;
while her gray woollen bathing dress
might have passed for a new sort of
flannel feathers. A mortified blue sunbonnet,
with all the canes out, was
perched lop-sided on her head, and
she wore a pair of bathing shoes, like
brown poultices. The rest of us were
just as bad, though; I was an ogre in
green flannel, Tom and Jimmy monkeys
in red, Mrs. Lawson tolerably
lady-like in blue, with white tape
trimmings, and Neighbor Nelly a
ridiculous little old jumping Jenny in
white, with gorgeous red facings; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
all in hats that defied our best friends
to know us in.</p>

<p>How we laughed at each other,
and then made haste over the sand,
which was so hot that it nearly
scorched our feet, and plumped into
the nice cool ocean, where ever so
many other frights were already hopping
about.</p>

<p>Now for a rush into the deep water!
here comes a big wave! down,
down now! and over our heads it
went! dousing us as it had Gipsey
the Saturday night, only we didn't
squeal.</p>

<p>Presently, some people who had
come from the next hotel, began
dancing the "Lancers" in the water,
ducking under instead of bowing, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
seeming to have such a good time,
that nothing would suit the children
but that they must begin dancing,
too; in consequence of which a wave
twice as high as usual came roaring
up, and carried Neighbor Nelly right
off her feet. Under the water she
went, and for an instant we were
quite frightened; but presently up she
popped laughing, and trying to squeeze
the salt water out of her eyes.</p>

<p>However, that put a stop to the
dancing; and here let me tell you,
that surf bathing is always a pretty
venturesome thing to attempt, unless
you grasp the ropes firmly, or have
hold of some older and stronger person's
hand.</p>

<p>There was one gentleman flourishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
about near us, who seemed bent
upon trying how many odd things he
could do in the water. Presently we
saw him going down head first, and
then his feet coming up in the air like
a duck's! It looked so comical to see
any one besides a duck standing upside
down in the water, that we all
burst out laughing, and just then along
came another billow, and treated us
each to a mouthful of salt water!</p>

<p>By this time we had been in long
enough for one day, for you should
always remember to come out before
you feel chilled, and so we waded to
the shore, looking more outlandish
than ever, now the bathing dresses
were all soaked, and hurried into the
houses to get dry and dressed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Surf bathing is a famous thing to
give you an appetite; and I don't
wonder Mr. Laird provides so bountiful
and well cooked a dinner, when
I think of the famishing five hundred
people that were to be fed the day I
was there, and every day beside. The
"Charge of the Light Brigade" was
nothing to the charge we made upon
the dishes; and as the dining room is
sensibly arranged with tables accommodating
about a dozen people each,
we all sat together; and had such a
merry time that two or three cross old
dames looked sharply at our party,
very curious to know what all the
laughing was about. Our small friend
Gipsey was the cause of it, partly, for
he posted himself beside each of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
chairs in turn, and made such surprising
and despairing hops and skips after
bits of chicken held up beyond his
reach, that he very nearly turned a
somerset each time.</p>

<p>We rewarded his patience at last
by giving him some bones, which he
crunched under the table with perfect
satisfaction, while we were discussing
the ice cream and other good
things.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I was sitting
reading the paper on the upper piazza,
and the children were amusing themselves
in their own fashion near me.
Nelly, with another little girl, whose
name seemed to be "Baby," for they
never called her anything else, were
manufacturing a resplendent doll's dress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
for a waxen angel in a white spencer&mdash;or
whatever those muslin concerns are
called, which the ladies wear with colored
skirts nowadays, and a black velvet
pointed belt; while the boys, with
their arms fraternally entwined, were
interchanging confidences on the important
subjects of "My peg top,"
"Don't you think thirty-eight cents is
a tremendous price for kites?" "How
many glass agates have you got?"
and so on&mdash;when Tom, looking very
mischievous, suddenly lifted up dolly
by the toe of her shoe, and asked,
"Why, Nelly, what's the matter with
this doll; has she got the spinal complaint?"</p>

<p>"No, you goose," said Nelly, laughing.
"What makes you ask that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because she has on a supporter,"
said Tom, with perfect gravity, pointing
to the velvet belt. "Poor thing!
why don't you take her in bathing?
It would do her health good, I'm
sure; she looks fearfully pale."</p>

<p>"Ah, make him put her down,
Nelly," said Baby; "he'll break her
if he goes on so;" for Tom was now
amusing himself by balancing dolly on
her head in his hand, making a great
display of embroidered trowsers and
hoop petticoats; and now, catching
her by both hands, he suddenly swung
her over the railing. "This is the way
she ought to be ducked under the
waves!" he added. Nelly sprang forward
at the same moment with an
"Oh, Tom! please!" and caught his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
arm rather suddenly. His hold relaxed
at the same moment, and crash!
down tumbled poor dolly on the
ground below, breaking one of her
wax arms completely off, and making
a fearful cavity in her forehead, which
killed her completely! that is, I should
think so. I never heard of any one
who survived fracture of the skull.
Did you?</p>

<p>Poor Nelly! She tried hard not
to mind it; but dolly's head was one
too many for her, and the tears came
rolling quickly down her cheeks as she
gazed at the unfortunate waxen damsel
below, with quivering lip. Tom
turned red and white alternately in
silence for a moment, and then began
pouring forth apologies and regrets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
He called himself all the imps that
ever were heard of for being so careless;
he offered to go to New York
that very day to buy another doll,
and have his hair well pulled beside,
if she only would forgive him, and say
she didn't think he had done it on
purpose; and, in short, we had quite
a little scene; when, fortunately, there
occurred to me a pleasant means of
diverting the minds of the party from
the accident that had happened. So I
laid down my paper, as though I had
not been listening, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, little people, I believe I
have discovered all the news there is;
so what do you say to coming to a
party I am thinking of giving in my
room?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"A party!" cried the children,
dropping the subject of the doll to
look at me; "why, we should like
that very much. What sort of a party
is it?"</p>

<p>"A reading party," I answered.
"I have some papers I have been
thinking of reading to you, to get
your opinion of them before I put
them in a book; and I shouldn't be
surprised if there was a paper of candy
in my drawer besides."</p>

<p>"Why, do you write books?"
asked Baby, opening her bright eyes
very wide indeed, as if to be certain
what a real live author looked like.</p>

<p>"To be sure I do," I said, laughing.
"Funny stories, and sad ones,
too; and some that are every word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of them true, and others that are told
me by my friends; and you shall tell
me whether they are true or not."</p>

<p>So we all made haste into my room&mdash;not
the same I had when I first
came, but one on the front piazza,
near Neighbor Nelly's. The papers I
meant were my own, Tom's, and the
Fat Gentleman's stories, which I had
brought down with me, to look over
and correct. The candy I had bought
for Nelly and Jimmy, as I told you,
and forgotten all about to that moment.
Little Robby came trotting
along just then, so we asked him to be
of the party; and Mrs. Lawson, looking
out to see why we were in such a
bustle, made up the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'copmany'">company</ins>.</p>

<p>I wish you could have been at Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Party that afternoon. We made a
cosey little group, I assure you. Mrs.
Lawson sat by the table with her sewing;
Tom established himself close to
my chair, and Nelly nestled by my
other side. Baby and Jimmy sat on
hassocks, contrived from carpet bags,
at my feet; dear little Robby was lifted
to my knee, and the reading began.
Oh, the laughter, and comical wonder,
and blushes, when my little neighbors
found the stories were about them!
Nelly burst out with "Oh, Neighbor
Oldbird!" and hid her face on my
shoulder every time there was some
special praise of herself. Tom turned
perfectly crimson when we came to
his story, and was in and out of his
seat twenty times, begging me to stop,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
during its progress, his splendid black
eyes glancing appealingly at me and
Nelly by turns. I wouldn't spare him
a single word, however; and when I
came to his declaration at the end,
concerning Nelly, there was a general
shout of laughter.</p>

<p>"There's an eligible offer for you,
Miss Nell," I said solemnly. "You'd
better take it into consideration!"
and so on, until Mrs. Lawson begged
me to stop. She did not like to have
ideas about marriage put into the children's
heads; and I, when I reflected,
was very sorry I had been so thoughtless.
Tom bore my teasing manfully;
but Nelly's face was rather grave, as
if she did not like such remarks to
be made about her; so I hurried on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to the Fat Gentleman's story, and
brought up at the end, and then
handed round the candy, amid general
approbation.</p>

<p>How we all passed that evening
together on the beach, and had a
wildly happy time; how we went in
bathing the next day, and the next;
and how, on Wednesday afternoon, I
bid a most reluctant good-by to my
little neighbors, I have not room to
tell. I want to write how gladly we
met again in the city in the fall; how
Tom did come to live in New York,
and favored us with his company as
often as possible; how we chanced
again on the little girl whom we had
met in the toy shop, and found her
living in a wretched tenement house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in Cherry street, whence Mr. Lawson
and I, with some other friends, removed
them in haste, and established
them in a nice little thread-needle
store on one of the business avenues
not far from our street; but all this
would take too long.</p>

<p>I must say, though, what a blessed
change it has been for them, particularly
for poor little crippled Clara,
who never fails to greet us with a
smile when we go there to see her, as
she sits in her comfortable arm-chair
by the window, with her pet spaniel
"Dandy" beside her. She is always
contented and cheerful, in spite of the
sharp pain that often racks her slender
limbs; and as I look on her pale
face, which is so plainly not long for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
this earth, and think that now her
suffering life will end amid comfort
and peace, I whisper to myself with a
heart full of love, "All this through
thy sweet influence, dear</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">And</span> that was the end of the famous
Sock Stories, which had afforded
George and Helen so much amusement
during nearly three months; for
it took all that time for Aunt Fanny's
daughter to write, and the children to
read them all. They could not tell
which they liked the best; for it so
happened that the "Funny Little
Socks" made their appearance just at
the time when some dear little cousins
of theirs, only four or five years old,
had come to spend a week or two
with them, which made baby stories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
doubly welcome; and I don't know
what the good and delightful gentleman
to whom the fifth book is dedicated
will say about it, when he sees
his name at the front; but it was
thought very appropriate by Helen's
papa; as the very best story in the
book is all about philosophers, grave
and gay.</p>

<p>One thing in particular I am most
happy to record; and that is, that
the good habits which keeping mamma's
little code of rules had engendered,
were not broken off at the close
of the readings; but instead, were
formed more lastingly with every
week; until now every one who
knows George and Helen says, the first
thing, "What good children they are!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and yet, they never have to be
whipped, or shut up in a dark closet
to make them so." No! they are good
from a higher motive than the dread
of punishment; for they are inspired
with the sincere desire to make their
dear mother as happy as they can;
and it would not surprise me at all if
Santa Claus, who is a very discerning
old gentleman, were to put something
very nice indeed in both socks and
stockings this Christmas&mdash;in spite of
the hard times!</p>

<p>And now, one last word, before
Aunt Fanny's daughter bids you good-by,
little reader. She hopes and prays,
in all sincerity, that she has succeeded
not only in amusing you, but in giving
you some lessons which will sink into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
your hearts for your real good. And
if in the shadowy train of personages
who have moved before you in these
Sock Stories, there is one who has
pleased you especially, from Colonel
Freddy and little tender-hearted Greta,
to Little Mother and the Old
Bachelor, Neighbor Nelly, with her
bright eyes and merry ways, or Gipsey,
of the cork-screw tail and yap!
yap! bark, the knowledge of this fact
will give <i>her</i> what she wishes for you
all, a very</p>
